#List of custom stats, note that stats are limited between -100 and 100
[STAT:CRITICAL_CHANCE] <- Used to calculate base critical chance for spells and abilities that can crit
[STAT:CRITICAL_BONUS] <- Used to calculate base critical bonus for spells and abilities that can crit
[STAT:CASTING_SPEED] <- Currently used to determine base casting speed modifiers
[STAT:ATTACK_SPEED] <- Currently used to determine base attack speed modifers
[STAT:SKILL_PENETRATION] <- Currently used to determine base resistance penetration
[STAT:HIT_CHANCE] <- Currently used to determine base hit percentages
[STAT:DODGE_CHANCE] <- Currently used to determine base dodge bonus
#NOTE: The game will automatically make several different stat combinations for each TYPE, SPHERE, SCHOOL, DISCIPLINE,
       and SUBDICIPLINE. These stats are;       !_CRITICAL_CHANCE
                                                !_CRITICAL_BONUS

   Also note that you could put these same equations in the wrapper script and they would work as well.

[EQUATION:FIRE_DUR_1:300+25*SOURCE.ATTRIBUTE.SECONDARY/1000+10*(SOURCE.SKILL.FIRE_SPELL_CASTING+SOURCE.SKILL.SPELL_CASTING)

 In order to evaluate an equation you can use;
  dfhack.script_environment('functions/misc').fillEquation(source,target,spell,'FIRE_DAMAGE_1')
 Special variables for equations
  SKILL.WEAPON = The skill level associated with your currently equipped weapon
  SKILL.!_SPELL_CASTING = Used in the Spell SubSystem, calculates the spell casting skill of the current school
  STAT.SPEED = The movement speed of the unit
  STAT.!_HIT_CHANCE = Used in the Spell SubSystem, calculates the hit chance bonus based on the TSSDS (additive)
  STAT.!_CASTING_SPEED = ", calculates the casting speed bonus based on the TSSDS (additive)
  STAT.!_ATTACK_SPEED = ", calculates the attack speed bonus based on the TSSDS (additive)
  STAT.!_CRITICAL_CHANCE = ", calculates the critical chance bonus based on the TSSDS (additive)
  STAT.!_CRITICAL_BONUS = ", calculates the critical damage bonus based on the TSSDS (additive)
  ATTRIBUTE.WEIGHT = Calculates the weight of the unit (not including inventory)
  ATTRIBUTE.FULL_WEIGHT = Calculates the weight of the unit (including inventory)
  ATTRIBUTE.PRIMARY = Used in the Spell SubSystem, calculates the average of any listed source/target primary attributes
  ATTRIBUTE.SECONDARY = ", calculates the average of any listed source/target secondary attributes
 You can also nest equations to provide extra functionality, for example
  -EQUATION:HIT:EQUATION.PHYSICAL_HIT_CHANCE-EQUATION.DODGE_CHANCE-
 Lastly, you can use built-in functions in the equations, such as those found in math.
